# BEM

[BEM][bem] is an [Object-Oriented CSS][object-oriented-css] methodology invented by Yandex. It started as a loose set of guidelines which led to a number of variants, such as one outlined in 2013 by Harry Roberts in ["MindBEMding - getting your head 'round BEM syntax"][mindbemding] which was inspired by Nicolas Gallagher.

In the time since BEM was first shared with the CSS developer community, Yandex has substantially improved and expanded on the BEM concept into a much more rigorous set of documentation.

For purposes of this documentation, "BEM" will refer to _any_ "Block, Element, Modifier" variant, while "Official BEM" or "Yandex flavored BEM" will refer to the BEM variant described by <https://en.bem.info>.
