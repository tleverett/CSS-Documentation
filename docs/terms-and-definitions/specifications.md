# Specifications

The W3C is the main international standards organization responsibile for specifying the details of HTML and CSS\*. For purposes of this documentation, W3C documents&mdash;and only W3C documents&mdash;are considered primary sources.

[MDN][mdn] has excellent documentation and detailed examples of CSS usage. Even so, it is a secondary source and will contain occasional inconsistencies. Fortunately it is in a wiki format so errors are able to be corrected quickly by the web development community.

> :warning: WARNING!

> ***w3schools.com is not affiliated with the W3C and [MUST NOT][rfc2119] be used as a reference***. While many developers have started their web development education using w3schools as a reference, much of the information is subtly incorrect and does not align with actual W3C recommendations.

<sub>\* Notably Ecma International is responsible for the ECMAScript standard, which is the official standard for JavaScript.</sub>
