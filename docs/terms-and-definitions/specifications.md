# Specifications

The W3C is the primary international standards organization responsibile for specifying the details of HTML and CSS\*. For purposes of this documentation, W3C documents&mdash;and only W3C documents&mdash;are considered primary sources for HTML and CSS. The W3C site includes a [list of all CSS Specifications][all].

[MDN][mdn] has excellent documentation and detailed examples of CSS usage. Even so, it is a secondary source and will contain occasional inconsistencies. Fortunately it is in a wiki format so errors are able to be corrected quickly by the web development community.

## There is no CSS3

The first [W3C CSS Recommendation (level 1)][css1] was released in 1996. The second [W3C CSS Recommendation (level 2)][css2] was released in 1998. The first revision of the second [W3C CSS Recommendation (level 2 revision 1)][css21] was released in 2011.

The revision to the CSS2 specification was in response to an explosion of new features by various browsers. As CSS spec writers struggled to keep up with the innovation being driven by implementors, it quickly became clear that attempting to shove every feature into a single monolithic specification was untenable.

Further updates to existing features were therefor split off into separate level 3 specifications, such as [Selectors Level 3][css-selectors].

New features would get specifications starting at level 1, such as [CSS Grid Layout Module Level 1][css-grid].

What this means is that while modern CSS is often referred to as "CSS3", there is&mdash;in fact&mdash;no such thing as CSS3, nor does CSS4 exist.
