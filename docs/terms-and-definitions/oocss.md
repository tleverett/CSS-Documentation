# OOCSS

OOCSS refers to "Object Oriented CSS" as [presented by Nicole Sullivan][ppc-talk]. This comes in-part from her [OOCSS][oocss] framework.

OOCSS is a significant early contribution to CSS methodologies for large-scale web development.

Unfortunately, the choice of terminiology muddies the waters somewhat when trying to discuss [Object Oriented CSS][object-oriented-css]. Nicole Sullivan's OOCSS concept can be considered closer to [modular programming][mp] when compared to more recent CSS methodologies like [BEM][bem].
